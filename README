NAME
    Class::Tie::InsideOut - Inside-out objects on the cheap using tied
    hashes

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5.6.1, and Scalar::Util.

INSTALLATION
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use `nmake' instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      package MyClass;

      use Class::Tie::InsideOut;

      our @ISA = qw( Class::Tie::InsideOut );

      our %GoodKey;

      sub bad_method {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->{BadKey}; # this won't work
      }

      sub good_method {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->{GoodKey}; # %GoodKey is defined
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a proof-of-concept for implementing inside-out objects
    using tied hashes. It makes use of the Tie::InsideOut package to tie
    hash keys to hashes in the calling package's namespace.

    Fields are accessed as hash keys, so in traditional Perl objects can be
    easily converted into inside-out objects.

    More information can be found in the module documentation.
